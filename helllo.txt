"Sweet Dreams"

Oh, does it get better?
'Cos darling nothing feels right
Oh, I know we are separate
But I saw you in the sweetest light...
Softness so tender
You saw the light had left my eyes
Oh, I know I hurt you
But if I can I wanna make it right...

For the last time, in love
For the last time, in love
For the last time, in love
For the last time, in love
